# Notes towards a short course on modern Robust Statistics

This repository contains material (notes, reading suggestions and topics) for a short
graduate course on Robust Statistics (Fall 2019).

## Tentative schedule

- Week 1: Oct 22 / 24
    - Introduction, goals, general setting
         - Contamination setting; Functionals, "bias", BP, IF;
    - Location / scale (**very brief**); M estimators of location & scale; Their BP, IF & asymptotic distribution
    - Linear regression (**brief**)
- Week 2: Oct 29 / 31
    - Linear regression (**brief**)
    - Fixed designs;  Random designs;  Regularized linear models
    - Non-parametric regression;  Kernel; Splines; Additive Models
    - GLM, GAM, GPLAM
    - Boosting?
- Week 3: Nov 5 / 7
    - Inference: asymptotics; bootstrap; prediction (AIC?)
    - Multivariate analysis
         - estimation; outlier detection; PCA, Factor Analysis, plug-in vs. specific methods; depth
- Week 4: Nov 12 / 14
    - Multivariate analysis
         - estimation; outlier detection; PCA, Factor Analysis, plug-in vs. specific methods; depth
