# Notes towards a short course on modern Robust Statistics

This repository contains material (notes, reading suggestions and topics) for a short reading group on Robust Statistics (Spring 2019), and a graduate half-course on modern Robust Statistics planned for Fall '19 (Oct - Nov 2019).

### Tentative list of topics for the reading course

- Introduction, goals, general setting (**Meeting 1**)
   - Contamination setting
   - Functionals, "bias", BP, IF
   - Reading: ["Robust Statistics: Theory and Methods", 2nd edition, 2019](https://www.wiley.com/go/maronna/robust): Sections 2.1-2.3, 2.5-2.7, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.7 
- Linear regression (**Meeting 2**)
   - Fixed designs
   - Random designs
   - M, M+S, tau-estimators
   - Regularized linear models
- Joe's question (Spatial statistics?) (**Meeting 3**)
